Car detection using YOLO model
# YOLO

YOLO ("you only look once") is a popular algoritm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time, almost clocking 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. This algorithm "only looks once" at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.

### YOLO model in car detection
-------------------------------

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tejaslodaya/car-detection-yolo/master/nb_images/fig1.png" style="width:500px;height:250;">

- The **input** is a batch of images of shape (m, 608, 608, 3)
- The **output** is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes. Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers `(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c)` as explained above. If you expand `c` into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers. 
- The YOLO architecture if 5 anchor boxes are used is: IMAGE (m, 608, 608, 3) -> DEEP CNN -> ENCODING (m, 19, 19, 5, 85)

- Each cell gives you 5 boxes. In total, the model predicts: 19x19x5 = 1805 boxes just by looking once at the image (one forward pass through the network)! That is way too many boxes. Filter the algorithm's output down to a much smaller number of detected objects. 

### Filtering
-------------
To reduce the number of detected objects, apply two techniques:
1. Score-thresholding: 
  Throw away boxes that have detected a class with a score less than the threshold
2. Non-maximum suppression (NMS):

  In this example, the model has predicted 3 cars, but it's actually 3 predictions of the same car. Running non-max suppression (NMS) will select only the most accurate (highest probabiliy) one of the 3 boxes.
  
  The steps to perform NMS are:
  1. Select the box that has the highest score.
  2. Compute its overlap with all other boxes, and remove boxes that overlap it more than iou_threshold.
  3. Iterate until there's no more boxes with a lower score than the current selected box.

### NOTE
--------
1. Training a YOLO model takes a very long time and requires a fairly large dataset of labelled bounding boxes for a large range of target classes. This project uses existing pretrained weights from the official YOLO website, and further processed using a function written by Allan Zelener.

3. Instructions to generate `yolo.h5` file can be found [here](https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K). Place that in `model_data` folder
